        <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p class="description">This meatloaf recipe doesn't take long to make at all, and it's very good!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 onion chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons prepared mustard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>
                Combine ground beef, onion, milk, bread crumbs, and egg in a large bowl, and season with salt and pepper. 
                Press mixture evenly into the prepared loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>Stir ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard together in a small bowl until smooth, and spread evenly over the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
